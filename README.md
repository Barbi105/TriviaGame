# TriviaGame

In this app, I created a basic 10 question quiz using javascript, jquery, and CSS.

The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 
    - The game ends when the time runs out or the player submits their answers
    - The page will reveal the number of questions they got correct, incorrect and how many were left unanswered.
